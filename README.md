I watched a movie “THE SOCIAL NETWORK”, where Mark Zukerburg wrote a program where images are loaded and anyone on the internet can rate those images as either HOT Or NOT, now the modern equivalent will be SMASH Or PASS. 

I found the program to be cool and it can be played among friends and students alike either in school or universities. I couldn’t find any Online game that offered this and was a bit bored too, so I wrote the program myself and used FLASK as backend to develop it.

### How to use it? 

Pretty Simple. Have the Pillow and Flask library be installed and later swipe the image folder path and run the python program. THAT'S IT!
